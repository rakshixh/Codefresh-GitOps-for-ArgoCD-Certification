### Cloning the Repository

#### 1. Fork the Repository
Click the fork button at the top right of the page to create a copy of this repo in your account, or go to this repository's [fork page](https://github.com/rakshixh/Codefresh-GitOps-for-ArgoCD-Certification/fork). After successfully forking the repo, you will be directed to your repo copy.

#### 2. Clone the Forked Repository
On your forked repo, click the green button that says `Code`. It will open a dropdown menu. Copy the link in the input with the label `HTTPS` or `GitHub CLI` depending on your preferred cloning mode.

For `HTTPS`, open up your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone <your-clone-link>
# or
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Codefresh-GitOps-for-ArgoCD-Certification.git
```
Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.<br>

You can also clone the repo using the `GitHub CLI`. To do this, run the following command:
```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/Codefresh-GitOps-for-ArgoCD-Certification
```

### Making your Changes

#### 1. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch from the main branch. Your branch name should be descriptive of the changes you are making along with your first name. Some ideas to get you started:

- For documentation: `docs-<your-first-name>`
- For adding new questions: `new-q-<your-first-name>`

To create a new branch, use the following command:
```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

#### 2. Make your Changes
To add new questions, follow the given format of markdown.

```
#### Q<Question Number Goes here>. <Your Question Goes here>
- **<Option A (Correct)>**
- <Option B>
- <Option C>
- <Option D>

> **Correct Answer : <br> <Option A (Correct)>**

<br>
```

>[!NOTE]
>You can add the `Correct Option` in any place but make sure to add `**` at the beginning and the end of the option.

Eg:
```
#### Q14. Garampani Sanctuary is located at?
- Junagarh, Gujarat
- **Diphu, Assam**
- Kohima, Nagaland
- Gangtok, Sikkim

> **Correct Answer : <br> Diphu, Assam**

<br>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You are to make only `one contribution` per `pull request`. It makes it easier to review and merge. If you want to add `multiple new questions` or if you have solved `multiple issues`, create `separate pull requests` for each.

#### 3. Commit your Changes
Your commit message should give a concise idea of the issue you are solving. Please be specific about the commit message.

To commit your changes, run the following command:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

Eg:
```bash
git commit -m "adding new questions to GitOps Fundamentals Level 1"
```
Push your local commits to your remote repository.
```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
